					"Standing at nearly six feet tall, the abomination has a head that resembles that of a frog but a mouth filled with razor sharp teeth. Its build is that of a humanoid, but it has skin that is dark, slick, and smooth. It typically walks on two legs, but when it charges after a victim it will go down on all fours, digging into the ground and launching itself forward with its powerful legs. Its webbed hands and feet both end in vicious claws that can tear through flesh and even metal. These combined with the guiding fin on its back allow the abomination to swim at incredible speeds. Being in the water with one of these entities is certain death.",
					"Toxic Bite. The abomination produces a potent neurotoxin that it delivers via its bite, paralyzing victims so that it can drag them back to its lair far beneath the surface of the water. The lucky ones drown helplessly as the abomination pulls them down into the depths. The unlucky ones are feasted upon while still alive, unable to move their vocal chords enough to call out for help or even cry out in pain. When especially hungry, the abomination has been known to bury victims up to their neck in mud and allow them to call for help. The abomination will then devour those that come to the rescue.",
					"Manifestation of Nature. Many believe these abominations are the result of nature retaliating against the misuse of its resources. A human corpse left to decay in the lake is claimed by a wrathful nature spirit, infused with the sinful waste of the villagers, and unleashed back upon them. There is only ever one abomination living in a single body of water at a time and it is always in fresh water that has been heavily polluted. Some villagers will attempt to make things right by cleaning up these bodies of water and imploring others to do the same.",

Every moment of life is agony for these creatures and they seek to inflict this same pain on others.

The left half remains relatively untouched except for a few wires that dig into its skin. Blood flows through a clear plastic tube that juts out just below the lungs and curves up to connect to its brain. Most of its jaw is still human, but some of its teeth have been replaced by jagged metal shards and screws. One of its eyes is a glowing red sensor while the other remains ordinary, though horribly bloodshot. It is the portions where the metal and flesh combine that is truly unsettling though. Metal burrows into flesh with sharpened hooks that pulls and stretches the flesh but doesn’t tear it. In other parts, the skin grows over the metal, turning it a deep purple color similar to a bruise. In some portions, the job was not done perfectly and bits of organs are exposed. Bone ribs jut out through the metal panel on the right side of its chest. ",
