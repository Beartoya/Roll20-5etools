				"We thought it was just a suit of animated armor. How droll! As it clanked forward, we learned our error, for the foul thing was no mindless chunk of metal held together by magic. It had a fiendish presence that radiated from it in waves of bone-cracking cold. The battle did not go well, but in the end I managed to survive through quick application of alacrity-enhancing magics. Yes, I ran for it, very quickly if I might say so myself. — Algrid Henswaithe, University of the Vast",
				"Ghostly forms encased in overly spiky armor, chaos knights are the foot soldiers and agents of evil powers. They are somewhat ephemeral in nature, but instead of a cool nothingness, they can become a cold nothingness that rides the border between the world and other realms. This coldness radiates from their open helms as a pale bluish glow."
